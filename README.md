Assignment 5 for web programmming

Write JavaScript code that can be linked to an HTML page in a script tag so that when a button is
pressed, every table in the page will become "zebra striped." Zebra striping in this case means that
every odd row of the table will be colored to have a black background and white text. (The page's
CSS file has a class named zebraStripe that you can attach to the odd rows if you like.) For example,
the following page should have the following appearance after your code runs:

Note that each table has the same counting for zebra striping, i.e., the first, third, fifth, ... rows are
colored. The number of rows in one table should not affect the striping for another table.
